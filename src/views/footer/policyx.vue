    <h2>How do we use uploaded images?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your images are secure and will be treated confidentially.</li>

      </li>
      <li> We do not share them with third parties, do not publish them and do nothing else with them.</li>
      <li> At the latest about one hour after the upload we delete both the uploaded image and the result image.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Apart from that, we keep usage statistics (without images) and if you contact us e.g. by email, we also receive personal
      data from you, which we use to reply to you. If we have a customer/supplier relationship, we also use your data for
      bookkeeping and similar purposes. </p>

      German-language contract text shall be valid; under no circumstances shall a retranslation of the translated version be
      used. </p>
